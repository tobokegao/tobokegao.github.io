<p>For me, he is the one who gave me the opportunity to know about Commodore 64 and has been very helpful with the history of chiptune and many helpful articles, translations and information&mldr;</p>
<p>One of my influences as a digger!</p>

<p>He is a roadside chiptuner who has been active in GAMEBOY since the dawn of chiptune, and since his music was played at the VGMDJ event 88nite, I wanted to invite him to join us!</p>

<img src=/img/yuriumemoto.png width=320 height=320>
<p>I asked Umemoto san to join the event after learning that Umemoto san had created a chiptune and recreated it with a cello performance&mldr;!(<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=OdEGftdC2jE">https://youtube.com/watch?v=OdEGftdC2jE</a> ) I am one of those who are very much looking forward to the performance on the day of the event.</p>

<p><strong>sdhizumi</strong></p>
<img src=/img/sdhizumi.png width=320 height=320>
<p>I invited sdhizumi, who has been a close friend of mine since I started playing on chiptune, because I wanted him to join us!</p>
<p>I also wanted to check out how we have evolved together, such as the increase in the number of game consoles we play on, the m8 tracker, and our affinity for Y2K-like hobbies.</p>
<p><a href=https://sdhizumi.com/>homepage</a></p>
<p><strong>AVGN crew</strong></p>
<img src=/img/AVGN.png width=320 height=320>
<p>I had the opportunity to participate in an AVGN event, which was a lot of fun, and I wanted to capture the atmosphere of the VGMDJ, so I asked them to participate in my event as well!</p>

<p><strong>Ca5</strong></p>
<img src=/img/ca5.png width=320 height=320>
<p>One of the organizers of ESC TRAX (my first EP was released here), ca5 san, who is also a major figure in chipbreak, is actually from Sapporo! So I decided to have someone from Sapporo join us&mldr;!</p>

<p><strong>葛飾出身</strong></p>
<img src=/img/katsushikasyussin.png width=320 height=320>
<p>The band set also includes a man from Katsushika, whose official remix of the ending of POP TEAM EPIC has been getting a lot of attention lately!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m so glad they decided to participate because their Animal Crossing-ish vocals, treatment of square wave melodies, and GS band sound really hit the spot&mldr;</p>

<img src=/img/konamiscc.png width=320 height=320>
<p>memowave, who also participated in <a href=http://plustek.bandcamp.com/track/xepheria>+TEK&rsquo;s FM arrangement compilation</a>, will make an emergency visit to Japan from Spain as konamiscc!</p>
<p>This time, he will be DJing and singing mainly European demoscene songs, so please look forward to it&mldr;!</p>

<img src=/img/sausumaulun.png width=320 height=320>
<p>Yosuke, owner of barbershop/haircut VOX and label store LIKE A DREAMING GIRL (former vox cassette store), will join us as a DJ!</p>
<p>I invited him to this event because I like his CDs and his assortment of indie-related items!</p>

<p><strong>cvel</strong></p>
<img src=/img/cvel.png width=320 height=320>
<p>cvel participated in a compilation by Sapporo music circle prototype.<br>
cvel was great, making music that seemed to embody what was swirling around in his mind<br>
And when I heard that cvel originally started his music from the futurebass direction, I wondered if he might have an affinity with square waves. So I invited him to join us!</p>
<p><a href=https://www.tunecore.co.jp/artists/cvel>tunecore</a></p>
<p><strong>シロシビンズ</strong></p>
<img src=/img/shiroshibins.png width=320 height=320>
<p>A tabla player I learned about through a tweet from Chantibooks.<br>
The music drew me in with its techno square wave and vapor wave vibe!<br>
The performer, tktc szk, and I recently formed the Coyote Man Show, and I felt some kind of connection and asked him to perform!</p>

<p><strong>嶽本サライ</strong></p>
<img src=/img/saraitakemoto.png width=320 height=320>
<p>Actually, I&rsquo;d like to invite Sarai Takemoto, who has been helping me in the way of digs for many years&mldr; and I&rsquo;ve invited her!</p>
<p>I respect Takemoto because he has a great relationship with the art Takemoto produces, and Takemoto is very active in many fields, such as dense DJ music selection and composing music for nanoloop, etc&mldr;!</p>
<p><a href=https://www.saraitakemoto.com/>homepage</a></p>
<p><strong>tktc szk</strong></p>
<img src=/img/tktcszk.png width=320 height=320>
<p>Takatoshi was a member of lakeboats who was a co-star of my first live show in the early days when I performed with guitar, GAMEBOY and live vocals. Since we wanted to perform together again, we decided to have Takatoshi perform in the Pure MIDI slot!</p>
<p>They will be performing with heavy equipment&mldr;!</p>

<p><strong>ツポールヌ</strong></p>
<img src=/img/tsuporunu.png width=320 height=320>
<p>I&rsquo;ve asked Sophei Kobayashi, who plays on a modified NES and paints along with a wide variety of musical projects, to join us as one of his names, ツポールヌ!</p>
<p>If you want to know more, I recommend you to read this article!<br>

<p><strong>Tobokegao</strong></p>
<img src=/img/tobokegao.png width=320 height=320>
<p>It&rsquo;s me!!! I&rsquo;m thinking of doing a live show around this album songs and making GAMEBOY covers of the songs that influenced me in the making of this album to challenge DJs!</p>
<p><a href=https://tobokegao.github.io/>homepage</a></p>
<p><strong>豊平区民</strong></p>
<img src=/img/toyohirakumin.png width=320 height=320>
<p>I thought vaporwave and chiptune had an affinity in terms of fictional nostalgia, and when I had the chance to meet them a few times, I asked them to appear!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing the video work they will be showing this time&mldr;!</p>

<p><strong>hally</strong></p>
<img src=/img/hally.png width=320 height=320>
<p>He is a game music historian, game history researcher, game musician, and a chiptune musician, and an important figure in spreading the concept of chiptune in Japan.</p>
<p>I felt I couldn&rsquo;t not invite such a man, Harry, to this event, so I asked him to appear!</p>

<p><strong>hosotake</strong></p>
<img src=/img/hosotake.png width=320 height=320>
<p>Hosotake, the noise ch. of NES BAND, will also be on the bill!</p>
<p>He has been paying attention to my VGMDJ-related events and actually listening to them, and it seems like our DJ connection has deepened, so I invited him as a DJ!</p>

<p><strong>ヤギシロ</strong></p>
<img src=/img/yagishiro.png width=320 height=320>
<p>Yagishiro, the first Japanese artist to be released on my personal label, TBKgao, will also be performing!</p>
<p>His songs are wonderful, blending Vocaloids with hip elements and gently conveying feelings&mldr;.</p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t wait to see what the live show will be like!</p>

<p><strong>Rei8bit</strong></p>
<img src=/img/rei8bit.jpg width=320 height=320>
<p>Rei, the second Japanese artist to be released on my personal label, will also be performing!</p>
<p>Rei is quickly making a name for himself as a new-generation chiptuner, and we wanted to see him perform for the first time! Maybe the NES will be the main attraction that day!</p>

<img src=/img/60millionreserve.jpg width=320 height=320>
<p>I&rsquo;ve decided to have Furuno-san, who participated in my Pure MIDI compilation released by TBKgao and who may love Pure MIDI even more than I do, join us!</p>
<p>Of course, he will be performing a Pure MIDI set&mldr;!</p>
